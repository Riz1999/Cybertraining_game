## Issues and Recommendations

### Minor Issues

1. **Redis Integration**: Redis is currently disabled. For production, enable Redis for better performance with token blacklisting and caching.
2. **Image Upload**: Profile image upload is currently mocked. Implement actual file upload functionality with proper storage.
3. **Error Handling**: Some edge cases in error handling could be improved for better user experience.

### Recommendations

1. **Implement Service Workers**: Add service workers for offline capabilities and improved performance.
2. **Add Unit Tests**: Create comprehensive unit tests for both client and server components.
3. **Implement Real-time Notifications**: Add WebSocket support for real-time notifications.
4. **Enhance Security**: Implement rate limiting and additional security measures for production.

## Conclusion

The Cybercrime Training Platform is functioning well in the local development environment. The core features of authentication, profile management, and module navigation are working as expected. The responsive design ensures a good user experience across different devices.

For production deployment, address the minor issues and implement the recommendations to ensure optimal performance, security, and user experience.
